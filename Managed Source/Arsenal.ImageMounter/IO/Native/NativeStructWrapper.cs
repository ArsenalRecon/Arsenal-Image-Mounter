/// <summary>
/// This class allocates unmanaged memory for a native structure and initializes
/// that memory by marshalling a managed object. It gurantees that the managed
/// object stays alive and the unmanaged memory block is valid for at least the
/// lifetime of this object and that the unmanaged memory is released when this
/// object is disposed.
/// 
/// Since this class derives form SafeBuffer there are many instance methods
/// available to read and modify the unmanaged buffer in a safe way and when
/// marshalled to native code in for example a P/Invoke call, it gets automatically
/// translated to the address of the unmanaged memory block. It also uses reference
/// counting and is guaranteed to stay alive during such calls.
