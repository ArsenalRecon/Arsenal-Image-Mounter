----------------------
Graphical applications
----------------------

This directory contains ArsenalImageMounter.exe.

One-piece (with the exception of libewf.dll) powerful tool for mounting
disk image files as virtual drives. Supports raw disk images and various
virtual machine image formats through integrated DiscUtils library. Also
supports certain forensics image formats if libewf.dll is also installed.
Automatically installs necessary driver components if not already installed.

ArsenalImageMounter.exe requires .NET Framework 4.x, which is included by
default in Windows 8 or later. Can be installed separately on Windows XP,
Vista or 7.

Tested on Windows 7, 8.1 and 10, but should also work on Windows XP or Vista.

installing or uninstalling the virtual SCSI miniport driver.
